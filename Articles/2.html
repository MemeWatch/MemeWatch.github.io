<h1>Market Volatility And What It Means For Investors</h1>

<h2>What is Market Volatilitly?</h2>
<p>Market Volatility has the same defintion for all markets, Nasdanq and Nasdaq. It's when meme prices are volatile, or change frequently without much warning. Market volatility is a serious threat to many investors, as a stable stock could suddenly, and unpredictably, plummet. The inevitablility of this situation makes the Nasdanq market riskier. The average meme investor must adapt in order to survive. Risks must be taken,  However, many investors can still thrive in Nasdanq, even with the extra challenge. Now, we ask ourselves how we can do the same.</p>
<h2>Causes</h2>
<center>Market volatility can be traced back to a number of sources. Many investors blame Normies and day traders. However, market volatility is the nature of the meme market. In order to find out <i>why</i> memes behave like this, we must look into similar trends.</center>
<h3>The Nature of Memes</h3>
<p>Typically, the average lifespan of a meme is around three months (however, there are some exceptions). Any longer, and the meme will taken by normies. Because of this memes are brought and sold rather hastily. This causes a sudden (and often very short) rise often reffered to as "The Wave" by investors.</p>
<p>After this, the meme will retain it's value for a short period of time. This is called the "plateau". It will either continue to rise at a much slower rate, or start to slowly loose it's value. This "split" can cause investors to hold onto a meme for too long, hoping to continue the rise.</p>
<p>The fall of a meme typically happens soon after it's split. As investors see normies take a hold of a meme, they will start to sell, lowering the meme's value. Less observative investors will typically sell later, increasing the decline of a meme. This cycle will repeat until almost everyone has sold the meme, some being less fortunate than others.</p>
<p>These stages are typically visable in all meme trends, but can vary from meme to meme. While one meme may rise steadily over a long period of time, another will suddenly rise, plateu, split, and fall all in a day. This speed is dictated by it's popularity and exposure to normies.</p>
<h3>Popularity</h3>
<p>As previously stated, the popularity of a meme can increase its volatility. When a meme is noticed by many in a dank enviorment (4chan or Reddit) it rises. The meme is then quickly shared with normies, causing it to react unpredictably. The meme will often then go through all stages of its life in less than a week (or even more commonly, a day). This makes investing in memes time-consuming, as even stable long term investments may fall or peak in a day.</p>
<h3>The Ironic Bubble</h3>
<p>Another, less common, stage of a meme is the Ironic Bubble. After a meme starts to decline, it may evolve into something that induces the felling of irony. This joke often goes past normies, so the meme rises. The Ironic Bubble only increases the volatility of a meme, as it can start to fall, and then quickly rise again in value.</p>
<h3>Day Traders</h3>
<p>Investing in memes isn't for everyone. You have to have time, commitment, and a good eye. Knowing when to buy and sell is also very valuable. These characteristics are often shared by day traders. Day trading adds an element of risk to the already risky world of memes, but pays off. Day traders find a rising meme in the morning, and sell later in the night. Because of how common they are, they have an incredibly high amount of influence in the market, and can cause it to react unpredictabley.</p>
<h2>What this Means for Investors</h2>
<p>The incredibly high volatility of Nasdanq makes it riskier than all others, but often rewards diligent investors kindly. It can either be your debil, or your angel. This forces investors to put time and commitment into their investments. Should you buy without paying attention, you may find yourself in an over-saturated bubble, or in a meme that loses all value within a day.</p>
