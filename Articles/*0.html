<legend>Welcome to Meme Watch, a trusted news source by investors. Here you will find advice, predictions, opinions, and tutorials.</legend>

<h2>What is Meme Watch?</h2>
<p>Meme Watch is a community driven news source where mods and users alike can create and post articles, all centered around one topic; the Meme Economy. These articles feature advice, opinions, guides, explanations and predictions.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<ol>
<li>You or a user <a href="*1.html">writes and posts</a> an article to one of four catagories; Advice, How To, Opinion, and Charts.</li>
<li>The article will automatically appear in the catagory it was posted into, and also in New. <ul><li>You can distinguish the article's type by the top and bottom border color. The color corresponds to which catagory it was posted under.</li></ul></li>
<li>Something unique about Meme Watch is that we rely on our sub-reddit to bring us readers. An article is posted under our subreddit, and then automatically transcribed to our website.<ul><li>If the post accumulates a considerable number of upvotes, it can be viewed in the Upvoted catagory.</li>
<li>If a post accumulates a considerable number of views (website only) then it is moved to the Viewed catagory</li>
<li>If it gets a combination of both views and upvotes, the article is officially dank.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A writer can become certified by creatiting quality content. You cannot ask to be certified. You must be given the privelage by Meme Watch. Certified writers have their content appear in the Certified Section.</li>
</ol>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Why Tho?</h3>
<p>Meme Watch was created not to rival other news sources, but to strengthen the overall meme economy. If all of our news came from one source, the market would become manipulated by that news-source. Predictions would turn to fact, and not following advice could ruin your 401 kek. Here at Meme Watch, we believe that meme news is to be shared with everyone equally, no matter what they do or how many GBP's they have. Just like communism.</p>
<h2>Psst. Hey kid! Wanna help?</h2>
<p>Meme Watch is still heavily in the Beta process. In order to progress, we need help.</p>
<center>Things we need:</center>
<ul>
<li><a href="*1.html">Writers. And lots of them.</a></li>
<li>Help with hosting. We can't live on Github Pages forever! (And an SQL server. That too.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeWatch">Mods for our subreddit</a></li>
<li>Overall help of the development of the site. This includes, but is not limmited to:
<ul>
<li>Fixing Bugs.</li>
<li>A Reddit bot that transcribes posts from the subreddit into the Meme Watch website, organizing them into catagories by flair. I have no idea where to start on this, except that this would probably require Python.</li>
<li>Angular.js Routing to create a template where the Reddit bot updates the articles to.</li>
<li>A sign in with reddit feature, and a user page.</li>
<li>A way to grab new memes and put them on our <a href="../index.html#symbols">navbar</a></li>
<li>A searchbar that actually works.</li>
<li>A ton of more stuff</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Still Confused?</h3>
<p>Good. Being a proffesional meme trader is not an easy job. The path to success is a risky one, but should you continue, you'll find an oasis of financial security, GBP's, and dankness.

You are now already knowledgable enough. Now go, and build yourself a future.
